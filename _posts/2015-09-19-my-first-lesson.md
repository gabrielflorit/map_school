title: "My first lesson: copying Chaos in Yemen"

Let's get started. I'm going to copy this beautiful map by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/26/world/middleeast/geography-of-chaos-in-yemen-maps.html?smid=tw-share): [![Mapping Chaos in Yemen]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/yemen-original.jpg)](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/26/world/middleeast/geography-of-chaos-in-yemen-maps.html?smid=tw-share)

## Analysis: identify every design element

Some of this might seem obvious (e.g. scale, place labels) but I'm going to try and note every single design element, at least for now.

Let's tackle shaded relief first. Note that there are actually two parts to this: 1) the relief itself, and 2) the color ramp. Using a color picker tool I see that valleys are in light cream `rgb(247, 240, 230)`, and mountains appear to be in a dark grey `rgb(202, 197, 191)`: ![Color ramp]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/yemen-color-ramp.png)
